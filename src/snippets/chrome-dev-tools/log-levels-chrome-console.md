The Chrome console supports five different log levels:

* **Error** - Available via `console.error()`
* **Warning** - Available via `console.warn()`
* **Info** - Available via `console.info()`
* **Log** - Available via `console.log()`
* **Debug** - Available via `console.debug()`

Each log level has a distinct presentation. Error, Warning, and Info all get small icons attached to their log lines. Log is presented in a default black text, while Debug is presented in blue.

Log messages can be filtered by log level by clicking the filter icon and then selecting the log level you want to view.

More information can be found in the [Filtering console output](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console#filtering-console-output) section of the Chrome Dev Tools documentation.
