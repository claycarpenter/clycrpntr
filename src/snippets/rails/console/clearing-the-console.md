It's often nice to be able to clear deck when working with the Rails console. There are a handful of methods to do this, depending on your platform:

* `Ctrl+L` - Mac and Linux consoles
* `Cmd+K` - Mac console
* `system('cls')` - Windows console.

Thanks to [this article](https://pragmaticstudio.com/blog/2014/3/11/console-shortcuts-tips-tricks) from The Pragmatic Studio for pointing out the Windows console clear technique.
