OS X includes some handy methods for taking screenshots in the stock install. The screenshot utilities operate on two modes: save-to-file and save-to-clipboard. The file option seems to be the default, while the clipboard alternative is accessible by an additional hotkey modifier. To switch the command to clipboard storage, include a `Ctrl` press with the hotkey sequence.

### Whole screen screenshot

This will take a screenshot of your entire desktop. Note that for multi-monitor setups, this will only capture the desktop currently occupied by your cursor.

Saving as a file: `Cmd` + `Shift` + `3`

Saving to clipboard: `Ctrl` + `Cmd` + `Shift` + `3`

### Partial screen (region) screenshot

This option will allow you to select only a certain region of the screen to capture. After performing the hotkey action, you'll see a cursor appear. Click and hold to begin the selection, then drag out the region indicator until it's the desired size and release the mouse button to capture. Pressing `Esc` while dragging will cancel the action.

Saving as a file: `Cmd` + `Shift` + `4`

Saving to clipboard: `Ctrl` + `Cmd` + `Shift` + `4`

### Window screenshot

This is an convenient extension of the region screenshot action. Instead of manually dragging out a region over a window, you can press `Space` to change the region mode to window mode and click on a window to capture it. The window will be captured in its entirety, both the window contents and the window chrome (frame).

Saving as a file: `Cmd` + `Shift` + `4`, then `Space`

Saving to clipboard: `Ctrl` + `Cmd` + `Shift` + `4`, then `Space`
