One of the most useful tools in Atom is the Command Palette. It allows for a live text search against every command available in Atom, both within the core/stock installation and provided via plugins.

Open the command palette with `cmd-shift-p` and you'll get a search window (similar to the Fuzzy Finder) that allows for searching against any command. For instance, you can type "open config" and it will find the command to open your config file.
