When discussing HTML, many people use tags and elements interchangeably. While the two concepts are very closely related, there is a difference between them.

In HTML, tags are the opening and, optionally, closing entities that define an element. An element, then, is both the opening and closing tag as well as any content contained between those two entities.

For instance, these are tags:

```
<p>
<li>
<br>
<img>
```

While these are the full elements:

```
<p>Element text content</p>
<li><a href="/somewhere">Link</a></li>
<br>
<img src="/monorail-cat.gif">
```
