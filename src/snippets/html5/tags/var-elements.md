The `var` element represents a single variable. The variable type could be anything from a mathematical or programming variable to a rhetorical placeholder.

In this example, the `var` element is used to denote a variable in a mathematical equation:

```
<p>
  To compute the area of a rectangle, multiply the length by the width. The formula is commonly written as <var>a</var> = <var>l</var> * <var>w</var>.
</p>
```

You could also use `var` to identify a programming variable:

```
<p>
  To fix the null pointer exception, set the <var>foo</var> variable to a value of <code>"bar"</code>.
</p>
```
