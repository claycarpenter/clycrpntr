The `figure` element can be used to group a set of images into a single figure with a shared caption.

Here, a pair of images are grouped and presented with a single caption:

```
<figure>
  <img src="tiger-beetle-blue.jpg">
  <img src="tiger-beetle-green.jpg">
  <figcaption>A pair of Festive Tiger Beetles, showing off their iridescent shells.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

The result looks like this:

<div>
  <figure>
    <img src="tiger-beetle-blue.jpg">
    <img src="tiger-beetle-green.jpg">
    <figcaption>A pair of Festive Tiger Beetles, showing off their iridescent shells.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
